	abstract = {Wireless earphones are pervasive acoustic sensing platforms that can be used for many applications such as motion tracking and handwriting input. However, wireless earphones suffer clock offset between the connected smart devices, which would accumulate error rapidly over time. Moreover, compared with smartphone and voice assistants, the acoustic signal transmitted by wireless earphone is much weaker due to the poor frequency response. In this paper, we propose MagSound, which uses the built-in magnets to improve the tracking and acoustic sensing performance of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) earphones. Leveraging magnetic field strength, MagSound can predict the position of wireless earphones free from clock offset, which can be used to re-calibrate the acoustic tracking. Further, the fusion of the two modalities mitigates the accumulated clock offset and multipath effect. Besides, to increase the robustness to noise, MagSound employs finely designed Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) ranging signals. We implement a prototype of MagSound on COTS and perform experiments for tracking and handwriting input. Results demonstrate that MagSound maintains millimeter-level error in 2D tracking, and improves the handwriting recognition accuracy by 49.81\%. We believe that MagSound can contribute to practical applications of wireless earphones-based sensing.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we first study the problem of Correlation-aware Task computation offloading (CoTask) in mobile edge computing. Specifically, considering the correlation among multiple computation tasks, we study how to determine a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation strategy under the constraints of feasible offloading decisions and edge servers’ computation capacity, such that the overall task latency is minimized. Before addressing the challenging CoTask problem, we first investigate the case without considering task correlation, namely, NonCoTask. We prove that, NonCoTask with two combinatorial integer-continuous optimization variables (i.e., integral offloading decision variable and continuous resource allocation variable) can be equivalently solved by solving a 0-1 integer programming problem with respect to the offloading decision variable only, while the closed-form optimal resource allocation can be efficiently obtained under any given offloading decision. The 0-1 integer programming problem further falls into the realm of minimizing a supermodular set function with a matroid base constraint. We then propose a performance-guaranteed algorithm for NonCoTask. Next, we rigorously analyze the performance gap between CoTask and NonCoTask, and develop a correlation-aware offloading decision and resource allocation algorithm with theoretic performance guarantee for CoTask, via a correlation-aware exchange search based on the solution to NonCoTask. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms several stateof-the-art algorithms as well as their enhanced counterparts with correlation in terms of overall task latency.},

	abstract = {In this work, we study the problem of Robust Server Placement (RSP) for edge computing, i.e., in the presence of uncertain edge server failures, how to determine a server placement strategy to maximize the expected overall workload that can be served by edge servers. We mathematically formulate the RSP problem in the form of robust max-min optimization, derived from two consequentially equivalent transformations of the problem that does not consider robustness and followed by a robust conversion. RSP is challenging to solve, because the explicit expression of the objective function in RSP is hard to obtain, and it is a robust max-min problem with knapsack constraints, which is still an unexplored problem in the literature. We reveal that the objective function is monotone submodular, and propose two solutions to RSP. First, after proving that the involved constraints form a p-independence system constraint, where p is a parameter determined by the coefﬁcients in the knapsack constraints, we propose an algorithm that achieves a provable approximation ratio in polynomial time. Second, we prove that one of the knapsack constraints is a matroid contraint, and propose another polynomial time algorithm with a better approximation ratio. Furthermore, we discuss the applicability of the aforementioned algorithms to the case with an additional server number constraint. Both synthetic and trace-driven simulation results show that, given any maximum number of server failures, our proposed algorithms outperform four state-of-the-art algorithms and approaches the optimal solution, which applies exhaustive exponential searches, while the proposed latter algorithm brings extra performance gains compared with the former one.},
