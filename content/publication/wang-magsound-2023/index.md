abstract: Wireless earphones are pervasive acoustic sensing platforms that can be
  used for many applications such as motion tracking and handwriting input. However,
  wireless earphones suffer clock offset between the connected smart devices, which
  would accumulate error rapidly over time. Moreover, compared with smartphone and
  voice assistants, the acoustic signal transmitted by wireless earphone is much weaker
  due to the poor frequency response. In this paper, we propose MagSound, which uses
  the built-in magnets to improve the tracking and acoustic sensing performance of
  Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) earphones. Leveraging magnetic field strength, MagSound
  can predict the position of wireless earphones free from clock offset, which can
  be used to re-calibrate the acoustic tracking. Further, the fusion of the two modalities
  mitigates the accumulated clock offset and multipath effect. Besides, to increase
  the robustness to noise, MagSound employs finely designed Orthogonal Frequency-Division
  Multiplexing (OFDM) ranging signals. We implement a prototype of MagSound on COTS
  and perform experiments for tracking and handwriting input. Results demonstrate
  that MagSound maintains millimeter-level error in 2D tracking, and improves the
  handwriting recognition accuracy by 49.81%. We believe that MagSound can contribute
  to practical applications of wireless earphones-based sensing.
