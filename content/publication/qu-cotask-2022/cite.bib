 abstract = {In this paper, we first study the problem of Correlation-aware Task computation offloading (CoTask) in mobile edge computing. Specifically, considering the correlation among multiple computation tasks, we study how to determine a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation strategy under the constraints of feasible offloading decisions and edge servers’ computation capacity, such that the overall task latency is minimized. Before addressing the challenging CoTask problem, we first investigate the case without considering task correlation, namely, NonCoTask. We prove that, NonCoTask with two combinatorial integer-continuous optimization variables (i.e., integral offloading decision variable and continuous resource allocation variable) can be equivalently solved by solving a 0-1 integer programming problem with respect to the offloading decision variable only, while the closed-form optimal resource allocation can be efficiently obtained under any given offloading decision. The 0-1 integer programming problem further falls into the realm of minimizing a supermodular set function with a matroid base constraint. We then propose a performance-guaranteed algorithm for NonCoTask. Next, we rigorously analyze the performance gap between CoTask and NonCoTask, and develop a correlation-aware offloading decision and resource allocation algorithm with theoretic performance guarantee for CoTask, via a correlation-aware exchange search based on the solution to NonCoTask. Extensive evaluation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms several stateof-the-art algorithms as well as their enhanced counterparts with correlation in terms of overall task latency.},
